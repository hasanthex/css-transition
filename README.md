# CSS Transition Porperty 

Shorthand:
transition: [transition-property] [transition-duration] [transition-timing-function] [transition-delay];

some of transition timing functions are: 
  1. ease : a transition is slow at the beginning, becomes fast in the middle, then ends slowly
  2. ease-in : a transition starts slowly and then becomes faster.
  3. ease-out : a transition starts fast and slows down towards the end.
  4. ease-in-out : a transition starts and ends slowly.
  5. linear :  speed remains the same throughout the whole transition.
  6. step-start
  7. step-end
  8. cubic-bezier : transitionâ€™s speed curve is specifically defined by you
  
Browser support vendor prefixes are:
  1. -webkit-transition : values;
  2. -moz-transition : values;
  3. -o-transition : values;
  4. transition : values;
